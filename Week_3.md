**Week 3**

I initially had trouble wrapping my mind around the concept of using a website, Twitter, or a blog to develop a professional identity as an academic. Not having worked in a field where I needed a professional identity apart from the one the corporation provided for me, I tend to think of having a website or blog as something one does as a hobby, not as part of work. The readings were therefore enlightening to me. While going through them, it clicked with me that, in one sense, academics are professional writers and thus might benefit from the opportunity to use additional platforms to get their writing out into the world.

I appreciated the distinction that the writers seemed to draw between thinking of personal websites and blogs as unseemly "marketing" tools and thinking of them as ways to contribute to a larger discussion and potentially build community.

My difficulty stems from the fact that I haven't previously thought of academics as content providers

It initially struck me as too much like "marketing"

A Defense of Academic Twitter
will it still be around
how much to invest
what if you don't find sharing and conversing fun
sounds scary because i'm not in the world of having content to share
who's the public you engage with
temptation to use it for the things he suggests not doing
seems like good advice for using it well - sounds nice; not a replacement for all other forms - realistic about what you could get out of it

sounds like advice for indie band, tenure = label
my music should stand on its own and people should embrace it without promotion

A common error I see some academics make on Twitter is to set up an account solely to promote a new book or project. As academics, we all have things to promote from time to time: books, conferences, calls for papers. But in order to promote something successfully on Twitter, you need to already have an audience. Why would anyone follow an account whose sole purpose is a sales pitch? Build an audience first, and the audience will follow if they like you and will then listen once you have something to pitch.

But tweeting only when you're engaged in worthy academic activity creates a sterile feed. It looks artificial, like you're trying to present yourself as an academic robot. And as it turns out, showing your personality actually impresses students. - do you want people to know you have a life

nother common mistake is just to post links to articles from major publications without any personal commentary.

Because I mostly work from home, Twitter is the "water cooler chat" I would otherwise have with colleagues in the office. My colleagues just happen to be scattered around the world.

5. Engage in conversation. Don't just drop in to post your own update and disappear.

7. Don't just make statements. Ask questions.

The responses thus far seem to be from the converted despite that the article's target audience seems to be non-tweeters.  I am in that target audience and remain unconvinced.  In fact, some of the reasons cited reinforce why I am not inclined to become a twitter user.  For example, I feel a need to be more, not less, insulated from random information and contacts (e.g., the doc student who emailed me from afar asking for 10 viable dissertation topics).  I also often feel a need for more, not less, filtering of information.  I have a variety of non-twitter sources that keep me connected with noteworthy information and sources that are not shared at whim and thus more likely to be carefully reasoned and vetted from reliable sources.  Some of the information cited as usefully available through twitter, could just as easily be found through other online avenues.   For example, a host of lamb and bean recipes could be found with a few clicks on the Internet without bothering anyone else.  Likewise, email or blackboard forums allow easy communication with students.  Likewise, the retrieval of an obscure article might also be found through other means just as easily.  Nor do I feel a need to validate my professional identity or accomplishments by being re-tweeted by a "celebrity."  That is not to say that twitter may have some charms and benefits and that it may serve some people quite well for their purposes.  But, for me, I found nothing in this article that leads me to add twitter to an already rich and extensive repertoire of online options for communication.

or 5 minutes with the expectation of   an instant reply. This may sound like music to the ears of someone in the humanities like Katrina but a real nuisance to others.

In addition,   the benefits of Twitter listed in this article in relation to research  are nothing but illusion. There are many well established channels used by serious researchers to get the same benefits without the distractions.  Researchers have been communicating, exchanging information, finding what they need successfuly  long before Twitter and other social media even existed.



Katrina   said: "Twitter can be something you have on in the background while you work. "
Well,  this statement from a researcher in the humanities is quite understandable. I am afraid that in many other disciplines (ex. hard sciences) where you really need to focus on the task at hand,  Tweeter is too much of a distraction.

The Twitter Paradox: a tool that apparently requires the least amount of
effort to use (140 characters, plain text, zero bells & whistles, etc.) ends up being the most time-consuming to use. IMHO, that's the main hurdle for adoption among academics. It takes a while to see you are making any impact at all.

Googling
Readers know what is formal or not
Marketing or community building
Writing to help others not just promo good quote
Benefits of virtuous circle

Prfhack
Personal or professional is there any different
Balanced approach and options appropriate to field
Sounds like sites I've seen and liked
Middle publishing
Design is an argument
Remediation
Learn tools

Blogging...
Other forms of scholarship for tenure, how long before they are accepted and conservative probably good
Not saying it takes place of but understanding what is and does
Why do I think has to be like end of world
Oh internet
Figuring out in public risk
Does digital authorship concept make sense
